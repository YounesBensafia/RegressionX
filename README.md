# ðŸ“Š RegressionX â€“ My Journey in Learning Linear Regression  

Welcome to **RegressionX**, a repository where I document my learning process in **linear regression**. ðŸš€ I'm following tutorials, experimenting with datasets, and implementing regression models to deepen my understanding.  

## ðŸ”¹ What's Inside?  
âœ… Step-by-step implementations from tutorials  
âœ… Code in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)  
âœ… Notes, insights, and key takeaways  
âœ… Visualizations and model evaluations  

This is a personal learning space, but feel free to explore and learn along with me!
